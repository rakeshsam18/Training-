Kizie Basu is fighting thyroid cancer when she meets Immanuel Rajkumar Junior or Manny, who has previously suffered from osteosarcoma and is in remission. Manny and his friend JP, who is suffering from glaucoma, are making a movie together, inspired by Rajinikanth's films. Manny invites Kizie to be the female lead. The two bond over his love for Rajnikanth's movies and her love for music, specifically an incomplete song by Abhimanyu Veer. Kizie and Manny gradually fall in love as they shoot scenes for JP's film. After an operation, JP loses sight in his second eye as well, making him go blind.

One day, Manny informs Kizie that he has managed to track down Abhimanyu Veer and get in touch with him. Kizie e-mails Veer, who replies that she can visit him in Paris to get her questions answered. Kizie and Manny convince Kizie's parents to allow them to take the trip, with the condition that Kizie's mother would join them. As they are making arrangements for the trip, Kizie's cancer gets worse and she is hospitalized.

After her recovery, she is weakened and initially distances herself from Manny but later relents. They go to Paris to visit Veer, who turns out to have no conclusive answers, disappointing Kizie. Soon after, Manny informs Kizie that his cancer had returned and is now terminal.

As Manny's health deteriorates, Kizie convinces him to finish the film. Manny then invites JP and Kizie to his mock funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Manny dies a couple of days later, leaving a letter for Kizie, explaining that he had finished Veer's song for her, but ultimately had to take Veer's help for it. JP's finished film is premiered in an open air theatre, where Kizie and the crowd experience the emotions that Manny went through on screen. In the final scene of the film, he breaks the fourth wall and speaks to Kizie, to which she replies "Seri".
